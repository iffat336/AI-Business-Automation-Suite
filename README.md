## 📊 Modules

### 1. Sales Forecasting Engine
Predicts future sales performance using historical data, seasonal trends, and customer behavior patterns.
- **Models:** Random Forest, XGBoost, Gradient Boosting, LSTM (Deep Learning).
- **Features:** Time-series analysis, seasonality detection, and category-wise forecasting.
- **Outcome:** Executive dashboards for revenue planning and inventory optimization.

### 2. Customer Churn Prediction
Identifies at-risk customers with high precision to help businesses proactively improve retention.
- **Models:** Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, Deep Neural Networks (DNN).
- **Techniques:** SMOTE for imbalanced data, Permutation Importance, ROC-AUC/PR-Curve optimization.
- **Outcome:** Risk segmentation dashboards for marketing and customer success teams.
